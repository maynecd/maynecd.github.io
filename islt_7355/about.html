        <div><p>Hi! My name is Christina and I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I work at an 
            academic hospital where I serve as the Emergency Medicine residency program 
            manager. I am currently a graduate student in the Master of Science Learning 
            Technologies & Design degree program at the University of Missouri-Columbia. 
            My anticipated graduation date is May of 2023.
            <p>In May 2016, I completed the Bachelor of Health Sciences degree at the 
            University of Missouri-Columbia. I chose to pursue the graduate degree 
            program to better prepare myself to take on new opportunities within my 
            career field and support my residency program’s commitment to 
            leading-edge academic medicine and providing our residents outstanding, 
            unparalleled educational opportunities.</p></div> 
        <div><p>“There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an exam and finish with education. The whole of film, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, 
            is a process of learning” - Jiddu Krishnamurti</p></div>
