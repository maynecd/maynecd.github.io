        <p><b><u>Project Description:</u></b>
        This group project required the identification of a problem that 
        could be solved through the implementation of a training program. 
        The project required our team to analyze the needs for the training, 
        deconstruct the performance required for success after training, 
        and then we designed the training experience. The elements of this 
        project included needs analysis, learner analysis, task analysis, 
        content analysis, gap analysis, contextual analysis, training design, 
        assessment, implementation, evaluation, and a working prototype.</p>

        <p>This team project consisted of four individuals who are in 
        differing healthcare fields, but have identified an overlapping 
        issue within their career environments pertaining to errant 
        advanced imaging orders. The link provided shows the final prototype 
        for module 1. I served as the project lead and oversaw the project 
        deliverables and timelines. This project represents the competency 
        above through the representation of the two objectives listed above.</p>

        <p><b><u>Reflection:</u></b>
        This project provided me invaluable experiences pertaining to the 
        instructional design process and helped me to understand the 
        challenges and nuances of the process. The project left me with 
        strong foundational knowledge of the conceptual frameworks of ID. 
        The members within our team were driven, motivated, and 
        goal-oriented, which was a definite strength. One of the 
        weaknesses within the group was the varying levels of knowledge 
        pertaining to the subject matter, but those gaps were identified 
        early and able to be resolved through logical task delegation.</p>
