    <p>During the course of my career and exposure to the academic environment, I have become extremely familiar to what it takes
    to be dedicated and committed to quality, innovative education. After the completion of my Bachelor of Health Science degree in 2016, 
    I was undecided as to whether I would continue my education or not. After the onset of COVID19, the world as we all knew it changed 
    significantly and left lasting impacts that would forever detour many of our journeys and paths. It was at that time in my career, that 
    I made the decision to apply for the Master of Science Learning Technologies and Design program. It was my hope that I could advance my 
    education in order to take on new opportunities within my job and transform my strengths to meet the needs of the dynamic environment around me.</p>
    <p>When I started the program, I had grave concerns about my ability to not only succeed by completing the program, but also to do so by 
    maintaining a certain grade point average and leaving the program confident with my newfound knowledge. It is challenging to take on 
    graduate level coursework while maintaining a full-time career in a high stress environment in addition to the many other 
    responsibilities all adults carry and hold.</p> 

    <p>At the onset of the program, my academic advisor suggested that I stick with two classes at a time to limit the weight of the course loads. 
    My first semester was filled with mixed emotions as one of my class experiences was extremely positive and the other was not as favored. 
    As I continued with the program, I had the opportunity to express my concerns and share my journey and perspectives with one of 
    my professors. It was at this time that my perspective changed and I was able to find confirmation that I was on the right 
    path to finding my ultimate purpose.</p>

    <p>As I continue to grow professionally, personally, and academically, I have already found that I have integrated many of the 
    new skills and knowledge I have obtained in various projects. I am down to six classes left to complete, two of which are in 
    progress, in order to graduate. Given my background and my intention to continue in my current role, I am looking forward to the 
    future and being able to integrate my new skills in many different learning environments.</p>
