    <h3>A Little About Me:</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Christina and I am from <em>Kansas City, Missouri</em>. I work at an <em>academic</em> hospital where I serve as the Emergency Medicine residency program manager. I am currently a graduate student in the Master of Science Learning Technologies & Design degree program at the University of Missouri-Columbia. My anticipated graduation date is May of 2023.</p>
    <br>In May 2016, I completed the <strong>Bachelor of Health Sciences</strong> degree at the <em>University of Missouri-Columbia</em>. I chose to pursue the <strong>graduate</strong> degree program to better prepare myself to take on new opportunities within my career field and support my residency program’s commitment to leading-edge academic medicine and providing our residents outstanding, unparalleled educational opportunities.
