        <p><b><u>Project Description:</u></b></p>
        This project was a team project that led to the design and development of digital 
        learning game using Construct 3. This project required several variables 
        and was critiqued on the following elements: knowledge domain, 
        learning objective(s), game goal, core dynamic, mechanics, 
        assessment/scoring/rewards, core loop, and the production of a 
        working prototype. The project design required application and 
        justification for how the game addressed a minimum of 2 Geeâ€™s 
        principles of learning in games.

        This team project design provides players an educational opportunity 
        embedded within gameplay to interact with virtual gardening and 
        hybridization. During gameplay, players must explore the game 
        environment to examine and collect resources to create and 
        grow hybrid breeds of roses all while being exposed to potential 
        threats that may interrupt their success with propagating new 
        plant species. The workload was split evenly with my portion being 
        heavily devoted to research, content development, and articulating 
        the various elements for submission on the game design document. 
        This project represents the competency above through the representation 
        of the three objectives listed above.

        <p><b><u>Reflection:</u></b></p>
        The greatest strength of this project was teamwork; the pairing of 
        two people who are creative, driven, and goal-oriented. 
        Construct 3 provided numerous opportunities for learning and 
        experimentation, which was a wonderful experience. During the project 
        debriefing, we discussed our approach beginning with our initial 
        brainstorming session through the final submission and agreed that 
        if we were to do the process over, we would not change anything 
        because our process simply worked and I believe that can be 
        attributed to our academic styles and personal motivations.
