    “There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an exam and finish with education. The whole of film, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning” - Jiddu Krishnamurti

    About Me: 
    Hi! My name is Christina. I live in Kansas City, Missouri. I work as a manager in healthcare. I am a Master's of Science student in the Learning Technologies and Design program. I graduate in May 2023. 
    
    I have no formal experience with web design or development. In the past, I built two blogging websites for personal use and fun. At the end of this course, I expect to know the basics of HTML and CSS. This class will prepare me for an advanced web development course in the future. 
    
    Things I Enjoy in My Free Time:
    1.	Outdoors
    2.	Martial Arts
    3.	Motorcycles
