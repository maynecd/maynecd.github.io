        <p><b><u>Project Description:</u></b>
            This group project resulted in the development of an online instructional 
            module that provided learners with the knowledge, skills, and 
            appropriate abilities to show an understanding of game-based 
            learning principles and gamification. The online course module 
            teaches learners how to define and identify elements of 
            game-based learning/gamification and how to apply those concepts to 
            the creation of an online lesson using <a href="www.GooseChase.com">GooseChase</a>.</p>

        <p>The project team consisted of four group members who all had some 
        type of role in education of varying ages/environments. 
        The link provided shows the final prototype for the online 
        instructional module. I served as the project lead and oversaw 
        the project deliverables and timelines. This project represents 
        the competency above through the representation of the objective listed above.</p>

        <p><b><u>Reflection:</u></b>
            This project went very well and the background of each member was a 
            definite strength in addition to all of us having experience with 
            gamification and integrating game elements into meaningful online 
            learning. One of the biggest weaknesses of the project was the 
            ambiguity in the project guidelines. The expectations were unclear 
            throughout the process. I learned a significant amount of information 
            on the characteristics of meaningful online learning and the framework 
            to designing meaningful learning experiences. Our project made use of 
            the GooseChase platform, Google sites, concept mapping, and 
            collaborative workspaces for our project design.  </p>
